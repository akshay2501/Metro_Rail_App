🚇 Metro Rail Management System

The Metro Rail Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed to simulate and manage core metro rail functionalities. It provides a basic structure for handling train schedules, station information, and fare calculations. This project is ideal for demonstrating how Java can be used to build simple, functional transport management software.

🔧 Features
  📍 Add, update, and manage metro stations
  🚆 Create, edit, and view train schedules
  💰 Calculate fares dynamically based on selected source and destination
  🧩 Simple and intuitive interface for managing metro operations
  🛠️ Designed for ease of use and educational demonstration

🛠️ Technologies Used
  Java – Core Java used for application logic
  Swing / JavaFX – For building the graphical user interface (based on your version)
  JDBC – For handling data operations internally
